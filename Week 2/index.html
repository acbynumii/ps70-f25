            <h1>1. Box Design</h1>
            <p>For the design of the box, I used Fusion. Fusion is straightforward to use, and this process was made simple through parameterizing the finger joints (see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U2JPfkQpsE">video</a>). After completing the design, I exported the sketches and faces in DXF format to prepare it for further processing in Rhino. Next, the method of fabrication was laser-cutting, and I incorporated scoring, cutting, and rastering in the process. After the laser cutter was done, I hot glued the pieces together to make the result below.</p>

            <h1>2. Household Items</h1>
            <p>The process for designing these was fairly simple. First, you measure the dimensions of each object. For the cologne, it was a lot more challenging just because there was a lot of curves involved, but for the Expo marker, I used a lot of arcs and angles as well as the revolve feature. As for the cologne, there was a lot of cut features used in addition to the project function. Lastly, I made separate components for each assembly: the top for the expo marker and the top for the cologne. Constraining them included making the cylindrical holes in each piece concentric. For the cologne, I also had to align the faces such that top was facing the correct direction.</p>

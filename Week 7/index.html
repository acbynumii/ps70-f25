            <h1>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h1>
            <p>This week focused on creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the most challenging aspect of my final project. The project uses a microcontroller program with C++ class structure while avoiding the delay() function. This MVP represents a serious attempt at tackling the core technical challenges of the final project.</p>

            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
            <p>My SCARA MVP was all about getting the first DoF (Degree of Freedom) working smoothly, and the hardest part ended up being the mechanical tolerances since I designed the whole robot myself. The 3D printed parts had multiple iterations usually because either the assembly process was difficult or there was some unexpected friction, and figuring out how to get the most out of the rotary bearing took a few tries too. Even though my MVP didn’t reach the point I originally wanted, I made a lot of progress afterward, and working through those issues made the whole thing feel worthwhile.</p>

            <h1>Challenges and Reflection</h1>
            <p>While building my MVP, the biggest challenges came from the mechanical design and how everything integrated together since I was designing the robot from scratch. Tolerancing was a major issue, and I went through several iterations of 3D printed parts because things either did not fit correctly, were difficult to assemble, or had unexpected friction. I also had trouble properly integrating the rotary bearing, and it took a few design revisions to get it positioned and working smoothly. Through this process, I learned how important it is to think about manufacturing limits early on and to design around critical components from the beginning. Even though my MVP did not reach my original goal, the iterations I made helped me refine the design, make solid progress afterward, and build a much stronger foundation for the final version of the project.</p>

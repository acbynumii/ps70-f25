            <h1>Kinetic Sculpture Design</h1>
            <p>For this project, I decided to design a mechanism that translates rotational motion into linear motion. The yoke I designed using the slot function in Fusion, and for the crank pin, I decided to use a screw. I dealt with two very big problems in integration. One of them was friction between the two pieces of cardboard, which caused the mechanism to stop and halt randomly. The second was finding a way to securely attach the motor to the crank because oftentimes the crank would slip and disconnect from the motor. The guiding slots were very important to add in order to keep the yoke straight and get the mechanism to function properly.</p>

            <h1>CNC Design and Post-Processing</h1>
            <p>This week focused on designing and fabricating something using CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining, followed by post-processing using fabrication techniques such as molding and casting, vacuum forming, or composites. I used the ShopBot to create my design, then applied post-processing techniques to make a mold.</p>

            <h1>CNC Machine and Process</h1>
            <p>I used the ShopBot to machine the sign, importing the sketch then creating a toolpath using the pocket cut function. I set the depth of the cut to be 3 mm to prevent chatter from the end mill. The height of the sign is 18.2 mm. We secured the wood to the base via plastic nails with a nail gun. Initially, I tried to have the letters protude from the sign but that proved difficult, so instead, we just did a cut of the letters.</p>

            <h1>Post-Processing: Vacuum Forming</h1>
            <p>For my post-processing, I used a vacuum forming machine. It heats a thin sheet of plastic until it becomes soft, then lowers it over a mold while a vacuum pulls the plastic tightly around the shape. Once it cools, the plastic hardens and keeps that form. In the image, the top section contains the heating element, and the control panel on the front is used to set temperature and timing for the forming process.</p>

            <h1>Challenges and Reflection</h1>
            <p>I had a few challenges with the CNC machine. The first was that the size of the end mill would not allow for small letters to protrude from the cut as they would end up destroyed due to a weak bond betweeen layers of wood and chatter, and the second was that the wood was not cutting cleanly. There was a lot of burr after the CNC machining, so I sanded the wood and carved out stubborn wood chips in the letters before the vacuum forming. Other than that, the process was relatively smooth, especially with the vaccuum forming and the help of Nathan and Kassia!</p>
